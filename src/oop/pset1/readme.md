# Movie Database 
Let's say we want to create a movie, and have a responsibility for EUR 10 million of budget. To be able to make decisions, we should know a little bit more about movies made in the past. 
Luckily, there are some datasets easily available online. [For example, Kaggle offers large collections of datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) from which we have taken a dataset with all movie data from the past. 
## Data manipulation

## Language Constraints
You're not allowed to use any for loops in Java. All functionality can be accessed through the Stream API in Java 8. It allows you to manipulate strings and large datasets. 
Also, you're supposed to use classes and objects in the process. And before submitting, ask yourself if you're proud of your code ;-). 

## Questions to answer
